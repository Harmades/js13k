# Playback

Playback is a platform game in which you have to copy the correct path to finish the level. You finish the game by finishing all levels.
At the beginning of a level, the walkthrough is shown to the player. It highlights, in order, the checkpoints you have to reach to finish the level. Going anywhere but checkpoints results in failure of that level. Failing a level makes you restart at the beginning of that level.

## Gameplay

You move in a gravity-based environment. You have one jump only. You move quickly, but landing precise jump is easy with speed and air control. You can wall jump any number of time.

## Graphics

Graphics are round and flat like [this](https://codepen.io/desandro/pen/YebMXQ). Player, platform elements and props should be composed of simple geometries.

## Music

Triggering a checkpoint plays a single note. Triggering all checkpoints in order produces a melody. The melody is the key of the level, every other sound should be more faint compared to the level melody.
